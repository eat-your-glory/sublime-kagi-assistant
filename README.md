Facilitate a seamless transition between Sublime and Perplexity, while maintaining a clear and defined boundary: no AI in your text editor.

The text editing experience of Sublime Text is unparalled. It is a beautiful piece of software. It is like using one's "good pen" and "good paper" to write. It is you and your code. I consider Sublime Text to be a text editor, not an IDE. I do not want to turn it into an IDE. I want to keep it pure. However, sometimes I do want need to kick off a session with Perplexity. Hence, this package.
